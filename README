= GENOOGLE BETA ABOUT =

== Fundamental Informations ==
Genoogle is a software for similar DNA sequences searching developed by Felipe Albrecht (felipe.albrecht@gmail.com / http://www.pih.bio.br)

Genoogle uses indexing and parallel processing techniques and it is developed in Java.
Genoogle is free for use but it is not open source, yet.
The name Genoogle comes from Genes + Google, the final world domination plan is to develop a software to locate genes likes Google is to locate information in the Web and Genoogle does *not* have *any* affiliation with Google Inc and I hope its name will not cause problem.

It is a Beta Version of Genoogle, it means: it lacks some features and have some know and a lot of unknow bugs. 
So, I hope that the users (YOU!) will inform me about bugs and features which you will like to have.

If you really want to develop something in to Genoogle, contact me.

== Features ==

=== Actual Features: ===
 * Fast similar sequences searching.
 * Really good sensibility.
 * Text mode interfaces.
 * Simple Web interface (more for testing).
 * Good memory requirements. (For a 4 gigabytes data bank, it is necessary not more than 4 gigabytes of RAM memory).
 * Works (and tested) at Windows and Linux.
 * Data banks with more than 8 gigabytes. 
 * Console and batch interfaces.

=== Missing and planed features: ===
 * Web Services Interface.
 * Better web interface.
 * RNA indexing and searching sequences.

=== Missing and not (for so soon) planed features: ===
 * Proteins indexing and searching. (It will be a big work to implement it, but it is possible)
 * Clusters implementation. (May be my Ph.D. project)

== Intalation == 

=== Requirements === 
To run Genoogle it is necessary:
 * JRE >= 1.6 and the environment variable JAVA_HOME should inform where the JRE is, by example:  JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun"
 * Ram Memory: The Genoogle memory requirement is approximately 80% of the data bank size more approximately 40Mbs for Java run time.

=== Installation process ===
 * Download the package here (TBA)
 * Unpack
 * Copy the fasta files which you want to search into the fasta/files folder.
 * Run the format_db.sh script.
 * Wait while the data bank is formatted and the inverted index processed.
 * Run run_web.sh or run_console.sh . (The run_web.sh has also the console interface)
 * Have fun!

== Searching ==
Genoogle has two interfaces: a '''very''' simple web page and text mode console.

To do the search using the web page is very simples. Open the address ''localhost:8080'' at your browser and put the query sequence in the input box and click ''Search sequence'' button. Wait and the results will be shown. The console interface is much better!

=== Console interface ===

The console interface has the following commands:
 * search <data bank> <input file> <outout file> <parameters>: does the search.
 * list : lists available the data banks.
 * parameters : shows the search parameters.
 * gc : executes the java garbage collection.
 * prev and l : executes the last command again.
 * batch <batch file> : runs the commands listed in this batch file.
 * exit : finish Genoogle execution.

The search parameters are:
 * MaxSubSequenceDistance : maximum distance between two index entries to be considered into the same HSPs.
 * SequencesExtendDropoff : drop off for sequence extension.
 * MaxHitsResults : maximum quantity of results which will be returned.
 * QuerySplitQuantity : how many slices the input query will be splitted. 
 * MinQuerySliceLength : minimum size of each input query slice.
 * MaxThreadsIndexSearch : quantity of threads which will be used to index search. ( Should be MaxThreadsIndexSearch <= QuerySplitQuantity * 2).
 * MatchScore : score when has a match at the alignment.
 * DismatchScore : score when has a dismatch at the alignment.
 
search Genomes_RefSeq BA000002 result_file QuerySplitQuantity=2 MaxThreadsIndexSearch=2 MaxHitsResults=20
